# Suggested Programming tools
At the beginning, just any Java Development kit and any Text editor will do.

Then, I suggest that you install the same version of Netbeans that you will be using at school: you can find it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html) in a bundle with JDK.
